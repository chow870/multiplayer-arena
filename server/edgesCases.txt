1. once the game begins: 
    there are a few cases, like the server may crash, thus socket connections will also not happen.
    we will have to handle it by exiting the game, forced_exit.
    : so used the socket connections on the client side.

2: redis queue for the refund and reward generation
    - if not working then game continues till redis reconnects
    - else at the pushing time, does not reconnect then error 500 is thrown as forced_exit is initatied
    -nodecorn will pickup that up and put in the redis queue or report to the admin
    - refund or the reward will be initatied accorginly.
3. these were the main edges cases that i have tried to handle it.
